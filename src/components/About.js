                    I grew up in Brisbane and am now based in Sydney. I recently undertook a 3 month internship with Canva Pty. Ltd, where I completed a full stack project to allow Canva users to customise their link share images. I have accepted an offer to join Canva as a graduate in 2024.

                    I have always been creative. My hobbies include painting, sewing, and anything crafts. For this reason, I love getting to build websites, where I get to use my creativity as well as my coding skills.
