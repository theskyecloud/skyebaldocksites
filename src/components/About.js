                    I am a final year Bachelor of Computer Science student at the University of New South Wales. I am an adept frontend and backend programmer, and I love taking on new challenges.

                    I grew up in Brisbane and am now based in Sydney. I recently undertook a 3 month internship with Canva Pty. Ltd, where I completed a full stack project to allow Canva's website builder users to customise their link share images. I have accepted an offer to join Canva as a graduate in 2024.

                    As well as coding, I love getting creative. My hobbies include painting, sewing, reading and writing. I'm always learning new things and finding new ways to enjoy life.
