                Pricing can vary greatly between projects. Here are some of the costs to consider.

            <h3>My charge</h3>
            <p>
                I generally try to charge around $35 an hour of work, though I do not charge by the hour. I charge per project. I will give you an initial quote on the information you provide me, and a finalised quote after the designing stage. The price may be greater if you need your website particularly quickly. To get an idea of how much a website might cost, I have provided some simple examples in the Portfolio section with an approximate charge.

            <h3>Website devlopment platform</h3>
            <p>
                If I develop your website on a platform such as Wix or Shopify, you will need to pay an ongoing subscription with them - there are free versions of Wix and Wordpress but they leave banners across your site telling everyone who reads it you are using the free version, which isn't particularly pleasant. These costs vary, Wix charges between $15 and $60, Wordpress between $5 and $60 a month (or $60 to $700 per year), and Shopify between $40 and $600 per month. We will discuss the most appropriate plan for your website in our initial consultation. These costs will need to be paid upfront, as they are subscriptions to what will be your account on these sites.

            <h3>Website hosting</h3>
            <p>
                You will need to pay for a domain name, this is usually done through a yearly subscription. If your website uses a development platform, this may be included in that cost. I am paying about $15 a year for the domain name of this site, 'skyebaldock.au', but this is another aspect that can vary greatly. This will need to be paid before we can launch your site.
