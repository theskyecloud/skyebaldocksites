        This was a frontend university project, taking inspiration from Slack. I followed a spec, and have included a video to show some of the features. Features include infinite scroll, authentication, forms and form checking, pinned messages and their display, and more. I used Material UI components. There is no association with Slack, this is included only to show my skills.
